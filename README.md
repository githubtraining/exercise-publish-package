# Welcome to the exercise on publishing packages!

This exercise checks your ability to publish to a GitHub Packages registry. It is automatically graded via a workflow once you have completed the instructions.

## About this exercise

:warning: This exercise uses a grading workflow script `.github/workflows/grading.yml`. You do not need to run or change this script - **altering its contents will affect the repository's ability to assess your exercise and give feedback.**

:warning: This exercise utilizes [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), which is free for public repositories and self-hosted runners, but may incur charges on private repositories. See [About billing for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) to learn more.

:information_source: The use of GitHub Actions also means that it may take the grading workflow a few seconds and sometimes minutes to run.

## Instructions

<!-- Specific instructions for your exercise -->

Please complete the instructions below:

1. Create your own copy of this repository by using the [Use this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) button above.
2. Publish a package of your choice. Ensure the package is associated with this repository. Starter packages are in [`sample-packages`](sample-packages/) but may need to be configured further to complete this exercise. 

<!-- Add your steps below starting with step 2 -->

## Troubleshooting

If you are stuck with a step in the exercise or the grading workflow does not automatically run after you complete the instructions, run the troubleshooter: in the **Actions** tab select the **Grading workflow**, click **Run workflow**, select the appropriate branch, and click the **Run workflow** button.

The troubleshooter will either display useful information to help you understand what you might have done wrong in your exercise or redirect you to the documentation relevant to your exercise to help you out.
